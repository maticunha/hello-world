Monopoly: Computer Science Edition


Description

What?
Monoploy: Computer Science Edition is a Computer Science theme of a classic game. This project is an attempt to help new java users familiarize themselves with Java Terminology.

Why?
Java can be daunting when you start. Being familiar with the terms and getting used to what is "Good" and "Bad" should help new users. 

How?
We will start with the game board, and create player pieces, and buttons for options a player can make on their turn (roll, property management, and if time allows, trading). In the backend, we will have properties to track player position, money, and which properties are owned.
